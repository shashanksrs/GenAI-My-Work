They want to invest in AI PC where they can afford to invest 10 15k.
They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the opensource LLMs that we aare using will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.
We are just going to hook up a single server in office to internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.
